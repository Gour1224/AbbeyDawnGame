Players will control a band of valiant heroes from these kingdoms, working in desperate unity to complete vital quests, defend their hallowed lands, and push back the relentless tide of darkness that threatens to consume all. "Abbey Dawn: Last Stand" is a narrative-driven cooperative campaign, where every victory is hard-won and every defeat carries weight, shaping the destiny of a realm on the brink.</p>
            <p>This game meticulously weaves the strategic positioning and dice-based combat of Age of Sigmar tabletop battles with the resource management and tactical card play of Age of Sigmar: Champions, forging an unparalleled cooperative experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heroes of the Realms: Champions & Harbingers</h2>
            <p>In "Abbey Dawn: Last Stand," players command powerful heroes drawn from the Grand Alliances of Order, Chaos, Death, and Destruction. Each hero belongs to a specific unit type, granting them unique strengths, abilities, and a personal narrative that unfolds throughout the campaign.</p>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Order</h3>
            <p>The forces of Order stand as a bulwark against the encroaching darkness, united in their purpose to defend the Mortal Realms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stormcast Eternals:</strong> Sigmar's chosen warriors, descending like lightning to strike down the foes of Order.</li>
                <li><strong>Aelf:</strong> Agile and cunning warriors, masters of both blade and arcane arts, defending their ancient groves and hidden realms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Chaos</h3>
            <p>The insidious forces of Chaos seek to corrupt and dominate the realms, driven by the whims of their dark gods. This alliance encompasses the brutal **Daemons of Khorne**, the insidious **Daemons of Tzeentch**, and the zealous **Followers of Chaos**.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daemons of Khorne:</strong> Brutal, axe-wielding daemons dedicated solely to the Blood God, seeking skulls and bloodshed above all else.</li>
                <li><strong>Daemons of Tzeentch:</strong> Devious daemons and mutating cultists of the Changer of Ways, twisting reality with arcane horrors.</li>
                <li><strong>Followers of Chaos:</strong> Mortal champions and cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers, often leading the daemonic legions. If a unit card has no specific sub-faction unit type (e.g., DAEMON, AELF, GROT) associated with it, it is considered to be a Follower of Chaos unit and to be used with associated heroes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Death</h3>
            <p>The chilling legions of Death seek to claim all living souls for their undying masters, bringing eternal silence to the realms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soulblight:</strong> Ancient, aristocratic vampires and their shambling legions of the undead, seeking to expand their dominion of undeath.</li>
                <li><strong>Spirit:</strong> Ethereal spirits bound by Nagash's will, a chilling host of vengeful ghosts whose touch brings despair.</li>
                <li><strong>Mordant:</strong> Twisted yet noble, these bestial warriors fight with primal ferocity, believing themselves to be valiant knights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Destruction</h3>
            <p>These primal forces seek only to smash, consume, and lay waste to all in their path, leaving ruin in their wake.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orruk:</strong> Massive, green-skinned brutes who live for nothing more than a good, brutal fight, delivering bone-shattering blows.</li>
                <li><strong>Grot:</strong> A chittering, cackling horde of grots, ravenous squigs, and lumbering troggoths, overwhelming foes with maddening numbers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Units of the Realms: Loyal Companions & Hordes</h2>
            <p>Beyond the might of individual heroes, players can field supporting units to bolster their forces. These units are represented by <span class="keyword">Unit Cards</span>. When a <span class="keyword">Unit Card</span> is played, the card itself is deployed onto the battlefield near the summoning hero, acting as a distinct entity with its own simplified warscroll. These units offer additional tactical options, from holding objectives to providing flanking attacks, and their presence directly supplements the power and strategic options of the hero who brought them forth.</p>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Order Units</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stormcast Eternals:</strong> Stalwart warriors like Liberators, forming the unbreakable shield of Sigmar.</li>
                <li><strong>Aelf:</strong> Agile archers and swift skirmishers, raining down precise volleys or outmaneuvering foes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Chaos Units</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daemon:</strong> Brutal Bloodletters or gibbering Pink Horrors, direct manifestations of the Ruinous Powers.</li>
                <li><strong>Follower:</strong> Mortal cultists and warriors, forming the bulk of the Chaos incursions. If a unit card has no specific sub-faction unit type (e.g., DAEMON, AELF, GROT) associated with it, it is considered to be a Follower of Chaos unit and to be used with associated heroes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Death Units</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soulblight:</strong> Armored Grave Guard or shambling Deadwalker Zombies, forming the legions of the undead.</li>
                <li><strong>Spirit:</strong> Ethereal Spirit Hosts, passing through obstacles to chill their foes.</li>
                <li><strong>Mordant:</strong> Ravenous Crypt Ghouls, swarming foes with their numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Vampire:</strong> Elite blood-kin, often supplementing Soulblight forces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Alliance: Destruction Units</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orruk:</strong> Heavily armored 'Ardboyz, forming a tough core for any Waaagh!</li>
                <li><strong>Grot:</strong> Lunatic Squig Hoppers or hordes of Moonclan Grots, delivering chaotic charges or overwhelming numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Generic Unit Types</h3>
            <p>Some unit types are not tied to a specific Grand Alliance and can be included in any hero's deck, provided they do not contradict the hero's primary unit type (e.g., an Aelf hero cannot have a Beast unit card). These represent broader categories of creatures or constructs found across the realms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ogor:</strong> Massive, brutish humanoids, often serving as shock troops or heavy hitters.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle:</strong> War machines or chariots, providing speed, ranged attacks, or devastating charges.</li>
                <li><strong>Beast:</strong> Wild creatures, monsters, or monstrous mounts, offering raw power and unpredictable ferocity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Champion Units</h3>
            <p>A special type of <span class="keyword">Unit Card</span>, <span class="keyword">Champion Units</span> represent powerful, named individuals or elite formations that can be deployed by heroes. They function like regular Unit Cards but have additional strategic importance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glory Generation:</strong> While a <span class="keyword">Champion Unit</span> is on the battlefield and highlighted (e.g., by being the active unit or by a hero's ability), its controlling player generates 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> at the start of their Hero Phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonus Stats (Conceptual):</strong> Champion Unit cards feature small, colored circles on their bottom corners. A <span class="keyword" style="color: red;">Red Circle</span> indicates bonus Attacks (e.g., a '2' in a red circle adds 2 to its Attacks characteristic). A <span class="keyword" style="color: green;">Green Circle</span> indicates bonus Wounds (e.g., a '3' in a green circle adds 3 to its Wounds characteristic). These values are added to the unit's base profile when deployed.</li>
                <li><strong>Target for Abilities:</strong> <span class="keyword">Champion Units</span> can be specifically targeted by friendly and enemy abilities, making them focal points of tactical play.</li>
                <li><strong>Triumphant Defeat (Enemy):</strong> If an enemy <span class="keyword">Champion Unit</span> is destroyed, the player who dealt the final blow immediately gains 2 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span>, rewarding the elimination of a high-value target.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Gameboard & Layouts</h2>
            <p>The epic battles of Abbey Dawn: Last Stand unfold upon a battlefield measuring **50 inches by 40 inches**. This space allows for diverse tactical engagements, from sprawling open fields to claustrophobic ruins. An ideal game board layout for Abbey Dawn would feature a dynamic mix of terrain elements: central open areas for large engagements, dense forest sections (especially for Sylvaneth scenarios) providing cover and flanking routes, crumbling ruins offering choke points and elevated positions, and vital objectives strategically placed to encourage movement and conflict. Key features like rivers, hills, or blighted ground could further influence tactical decisions, creating a varied and challenging environment for every scenario.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Game Components (Conceptual)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Board/Tiles:</strong> Modular tiles representing Abbey Dawn's varied terrain, from the ancient forests to the crumbling citadel walls.</li>
                <li><strong>Hero Miniatures/Standees:</strong> Exquisitely detailed miniatures or standees representing all heroes listed in the "Heroes of the Realms" section.</li>
                <li><strong>Enemy Miniatures/Standees:</strong> A diverse array of miniatures or standees representing the various Chaos and Destruction units that plague Abbey Dawn.</li>
                <li><strong>Hero Decks (Champions TCG style):</strong> Each hero possesses a unique deck of <strong>25-30 cards</strong>, comprising potent Ability, arcane Spell, divine Blessing, and deployable Unit cards, as well as Quest cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Glory Tokens:</strong> Gleaming tokens representing the vital resource used to fuel heroic actions and card plays.</li>
                <li><strong>Wound Tokens:</strong> Markers to track the grievous damage sustained by heroes and enemies alike.</li>
                <li><strong>Dice:</strong> A collection of D6s for resolving the ebb and flow of combat.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario Cards/Book:</strong> A detailed compendium outlining the objectives, enemy setup, and unique rules for each mission within the campaign.</li>
                <li><strong>Quest Cards:</strong> Specific objective cards, drawn from a separate deck, that heroes can undertake to gain bonus <span class="keyword">Glory</span> or other vital rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Curse Deck:</strong> A deck of insidious cards drawn by enemies, unleashing negative effects upon heroes or twisting the very fabric of the battlefield.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Optimal Card Pool & Deck Sizes</h3>
            <p>To ensure balanced gameplay and strategic depth, the following guidelines are recommended for card pool and hero deck sizes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hero Deck Size:</strong> Each hero should have a starting deck of <strong>25-30 cards</strong>. This allows for diverse strategies without overwhelming players and accommodates Unit Cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Card Type Distribution (per Hero Deck):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Cards:</strong> 8-10 cards (utility, buffs, debuffs, movement, combat actions)</li>
                        <li><strong>Spell Cards (for Wizards/Arcane heroes):</strong> 4-6 cards (magical effects, damage, control)</li>
                        <li><strong>Blessing Cards:</strong> 1-2 cards (powerful, often single-use, game-changing effects)</li>
                        <li><strong>Unit Cards:</strong> 3-5 cards (deployable units to supplement the hero)</li>
                        <li><strong>Quest Cards:</strong> 2-3 cards (scenario-specific objectives or personal quests)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Draft Card Pool:</strong> The total pool of available cards for drafting (for upgrades or scenario-specific additions) should be approximately <strong>50-75 unique cards</strong> per Grand Alliance, ensuring a wide variety of choices over a campaign. This pool is separate from the heroes' starting decks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Champions' Arsenal: Cards in Play</h2>
            <p>The heart of Abbey Dawn's defense lies not only in the heroes' might but in the strategic deployment of their unique card decks. These cards, drawing inspiration from the Age of Sigmar: Champions TCG, represent a hero's training, innate abilities, and the blessings they invoke. Each card has a <span class="keyword">Glory</span> cost, representing the effort required to unleash its power.</p>

            <h3>Card Types Explained</h3>
            <p>Cards in Abbey Dawn: Last Stand function similarly to those in the Age of Sigmar: Champions CCG, providing a range of tactical options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Cards:</strong> Versatile cards that provide special effects, buffs to allies, debuffs to enemies, or unique actions, including combat actions. Cost: 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Spell Cards:</strong> These cards unleash potent magical effects and can be played by any hero. When a Spell card is played, it is placed on the battlefield. Its effects manifest based on the 'Manifestation Value' in its top-right corner when played in its starting upright position. The card may require rotation prior to the full activation of the spell's effects. Spell cards cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> to cast but may require multiple hero phases to fully manifest unless an ability or rule says otherwise. Casting a Spell card does not trigger refreshing a spell rotation on another card.
                    <p class="ability-text"><strong>Manifesting Spells:</strong> When a Spell card is played, it is placed on the battlefield. At the start of each subsequent Player Phase, it rotates 45 degrees clockwise. The spell's effects manifest when the card has rotated enough that its Manifestation Value (in its top-right corner) is no longer visible (or reaches zero). Once its effects manifest, the card is then discarded. If a Spell card does not have a Manifestation Value, its effects manifest immediately upon play, and it is then discarded.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Blessing Cards:</strong> Rare and powerful, Blessing cards represent divine favor or extraordinary fortune. They usually provide one-time, game-changing effects, such as significant healing or a powerful, un-negatable attack. Cost: <strong>3 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Blessing Limit:</strong> Players may have a maximum of 2 active Blessing cards on the battlefield per objective they currently control.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Unit Cards:</strong> These cards represent a group of supporting models that can be deployed to the battlefield. When played, the Unit Card itself is placed on the board near the summoning hero, acting as a distinct entity with its own simplified warscroll for movement, combat, and interaction with objectives. To perform actions with a deployed Unit Card (e.g., move, attack), the controlling hero must spend their own <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> (1 Glory per action unless specified). Cost: 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> (unless it is a Champion Unit).</li>
                <li><strong>Champion Unit Cards:</strong> A special type of Unit Card representing a powerful individual or elite formation. Costs: <strong>4 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong>.
                    <p class="ability-text"><strong>Bonus Stats (Conceptual):</strong> Champion Unit cards feature small, colored circles on their bottom corners. A <span class="keyword" style="color: red;">Red Circle</span> indicates bonus Attacks (e.g., a '2' in a red circle adds 2 to its Attacks characteristic). A <span class="keyword" style="color: green;">Green Circle</span> indicates bonus Wounds (e.g., a '3' in a green circle adds 3 to its Wounds characteristic). These values are added to the unit's base profile when deployed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Activated Champion Units (rotated) generate 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> at the start of their controlling hero's Hero Phase.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Active Cards on the Gameboard & Rotation</h4>
            <p>When a card (Unit, Quest, or a persistent Ability/Spell) is played and remains on the gameboard, it is considered 'active'.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the start of each Player Phase, all active cards on the battlefield (except Champion Units) rotate 45 degrees clockwise.</li>
                <li>**Exhaustion:** If an Ability, Spell, or Quest card rotates and the top-right corner of the card has no value, that card is considered exhausted and is discarded.</li>
                <li>**Unit Card Persistence:** Unit cards (excluding Champion Units) continue to rotate and activate their inherent abilities accordingly, even if their top-right corner has no value. They are not discarded due to rotation unless explicitly stated by another card effect.</li>
                <li>**Champion Units:** Champion Units do not automatically rotate. Instead, they rotate 45 degrees clockwise only when a specified card (e.g., an Ability or Spell card) is played by their controlling hero that matches a symbol in the top-right corner of the Champion Unit card.</li>
                <li>**Activated Champion Units:** A Champion Unit that has been rotated from its starting position (i.e., is not in its initial, unrotated state) is considered 'activated'. Activated Champion Units generate 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> at the start of their controlling hero's Hero Phase.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Battlefield Depiction: Heroes & Their Cohorts</h2>
            <p>On the battlefield, your heroes are represented by their miniatures or standees, while the Unit Cards you deploy are placed as flat cards adjacent to them. This clearly shows the champion and their accompanying cohort, creating a dynamic skirmish line.</p>

            <h2>Core Game Mechanics</h2>
            <h3>1. Game Turn Structure</h3>
            <p>Each round of "Abbey Dawn: Last Stand" is a desperate struggle, meticulously divided into two critical phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Player Phase:</strong> All valiant heroes activate, their actions chosen by the players in an order determined by their collective strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>Enemy Phase:</strong> The relentless hordes of darkness surge forth, their every move dictated by the cruel will of the game system.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Players must confer and decide the optimal order in which their heroes will activate during their phase, for timing can be the key to victory.</p>

            <h3>2. Player Phase</h3>
            <p>During a hero's activation, they perform the following steps in a precise sequence, unleashing their might upon the foes of Abbey Dawn:</p>
            <h4>Glory Generation</h4>
            <p>Each hero begins their activation with a unique amount of <span class="keyword">Starting Glory Tokens</span>, as indicated on their warscroll. Additionally, heroes generate a fixed amount of <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> at the start of their activation, also indicated on their warscroll. The ebb and flow of battle can grant additional opportunities for Glory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the dawn of their activation, each hero generates their specified <span class="keyword">Glory per Turn</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Objectives:</strong> If a hero or a unit they control starts their activation holding an objective (i.e., they are the only units within 3" of an objective marker), they generate 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span>. This rewards tactical positioning and control of vital points.</li>
                <li><strong>Activated Champion Units:</strong> An 'activated' Champion Unit (one that has been rotated from its initial position) generates 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> at the start of their controlling hero's Hero Phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Triumphant Defeat:</strong> When a hero or a unit they control defeats an enemy unit (including <span class="keyword">Champion Units</span>) or champion, the controlling player immediately gains 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span>. If the defeated unit was an enemy <span class="keyword">Champion Unit</span>, the player gains 2 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> instead. This fuels further aggression and rewards decisive blows.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Heroic Prowess and Glory:</strong> The varying <span class="keyword">Starting Glory</span> and <span class="keyword">Glory per Turn</span> values on each hero's warscroll are designed to reflect their inherent power and strategic role. More powerful or agile heroes may have abilities that generate Glory in unique ways, or their cards may have lower Glory costs, allowing them to perform more actions or unleash more devastating effects in a single turn. Conversely, more resilient or slower heroes might have higher Glory costs for their powerful actions, emphasizing their deliberate, impactful actions.</p>
            <h4>Card Play & Actions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Heroes possess a hand of potent cards, drawn from their unique, character-specific deck.</li>
                <li>Most cards (Ability, Unit, Spell) cost <strong>1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span></strong> to play.</li>
                <li><span class="keyword">Quest</span> cards cost <strong>2 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong> to play.</li>
                <li><span class="keyword">Blessing</span> cards cost <strong>3 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong> to play.</li>
                <li><span class="keyword">Champion Unit</span> cards cost <strong>4 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong> to play.</li>
                <li>Players may play any number of cards as long as they command sufficient <span class="keyword">Glory</span>.</li>
                <li>The playing of cards empowers heroes to perform crucial actions: swift movement, devastating attacks, or the invocation of unique abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Glory Limit:</strong> A player may spend a maximum of 4 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> during a single turn. This limit applies to all Glory spent on cards, unit activations, and card management actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Movement</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Each hero possesses a base Movement characteristic. Playing specific <span class="keyword">Ability</span> cards can modify this, allowing for heroic charges or cunning repositioning. Movement is measured from any point on the hero's base to any point on their base.</li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: Knight-Questor Kelly plays her 'Swift Charge' <span class="keyword">Ability</span> card (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>), granting her additional movement to engage the foe.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Combat (via <span class="keyword">Ability</span> Cards)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Combat is initiated by playing an <span class="keyword">Ability</span> card (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>) that specifies an attack.</li>
                <li>Each attack specifies its range (Melee or Ranged), number of targets, and combat profile (To Hit, To Wound, Rend, Damage).</li>
                <li><strong>To Hit:</strong> Roll D6s. Each roll equal to or greater than the target's Defence is a hit.</li>
                <li><strong>To Wound:</strong> For each hit, roll D6. Each roll equal to or greater than the target's Toughness is a wound.</li>
                <li><strong>Rend & Damage:</strong> <span class="keyword">Rend</span> reduces the target's Save roll. <span class="keyword">Damage</span> is inflicted for unsaved wounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Saves (via <span class="keyword">Ability</span> Cards):</strong> When a unit suffers a wound, roll a D6. If the roll is equal to or greater than the unit's Save (after Rend), the wound is negated. Players can play <span class="keyword">Ability</span> cards (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>) to modify Saves or negate damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Wounds:</strong> Unsaved wounds inflict <span class="keyword">Wounds</span>. When a unit's Wounds taken equals or exceeds its maximum Wounds, it is removed from play.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5><span class="keyword">Ability</span> Cards</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>These versatile cards provide special effects, buffs, debuffs, or unique actions. Cost: 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span>.</li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: Spirit-Warden Vicki plays 'Strategic Reposition' (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>) to move herself and a nearby ally.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5><span class="keyword">Spell</span> Cards</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>These cards unleash potent magical effects and can be played by any hero. When a Spell card is played, it is placed on the battlefield. Its effects manifest based on the 'Manifestation Value' in its top-right corner when played in its starting upright position. The card may require rotation prior to the full activation of the spell's effects. Spell cards cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> to cast but may require multiple hero phases to fully manifest unless an ability or rule says otherwise. Casting a Spell card does not trigger refreshing a spell rotation on another card.
                    <p class="ability-text"><strong>Manifesting Spells:</strong> When a Spell card is played, it is placed on the battlefield. At the start of each subsequent Player Phase, it rotates 45 degrees clockwise. The spell's effects manifest when the card has rotated enough that its Manifestation Value (in its top-right corner) is no longer visible (or reaches zero). Once its effects manifest, the card is then discarded. If a Spell card does not have a Manifestation Value, its effects manifest immediately upon play, and it is then discarded.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: A player plays 'Arcane Shield' (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>). This Spell card has a Manifestation Value of '1' in its top-right corner. It is placed on the battlefield. At the start of the next Player Phase, it rotates 45 degrees. Its Manifestation Value is now gone, so its effects manifest: all allied heroes within 6 inches of the casting hero gain a +1 bonus to their Save rolls. The card is then discarded.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5><span class="keyword">Blessing</span> Cards</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Rare and powerful, Blessing cards provide one-time, game-changing effects. Cost: <strong>3 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong>.</li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: Branchwraith Daniel plays 'Nature's Renewal' (cost 3 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>) to heal all allied heroes within range.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5><span class="keyword">Unit</span> Cards</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Represent supporting models deployed to the battlefield. Playing a <span class="keyword">Unit Card</span> (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>, unless Champion Unit) places it on the board near the summoning hero.</li>
                <li>To perform actions with a deployed Unit Card (move, attack), the controlling hero must spend their own <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> (1 Glory per action unless specified).</li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: A player plays a 'Liberator Unit' card (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>). Michael spends 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> to move them and another 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> for their attack.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5><span class="keyword">Champion Unit</span> Cards</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Special Unit Cards representing powerful individuals. Cost: <strong>4 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong>.</li>
                <li>Activated Champion Units (rotated) generate 1 additional <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> at the start of their controlling hero's Hero Phase.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5><span class="keyword">Quest</span> Cards</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Specific objectives played from hand. Placed on the board when played. Cost: <strong>2 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span></strong>.</li>
                <li>When completed, a Quest card rotates 90 degrees clockwise. Once rotated 360 degrees, it is discarded. Certain abilities or spells may cause Quest cards to rotate.</li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: A 'Secure the Old Mill' Quest card requires a hero to end their activation within 3 inches of the objective for two consecutive turns. Upon completion, it rotates.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Reactive Card Play</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain cards can be played outside your hero's normal activation in response to specific triggers. Cost: Normal Glory cost (1, 2, 3, or 4 Glory).</li>
                <li class="example"><em>Example: An enemy attacks Kelly. Arion plays 'Azyrite Shield' (cost 1 <span class="keyword">Glory</span>, Reactive) to grant Kelly a +1 Save bonus.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Glory for Card Management</h5>
            <p>Unspent <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> can be used to manipulate your hand and deck:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Draw Cards:</strong> Spend 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> to draw 2 cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Shuffle Hand:</strong> Spend 2 <span class="keyword">Glory Tokens</span> to shuffle your hand into your deck and draw new cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Replenish Glory:</strong> Discard 2 cards to gain 1 <span class="keyword">Glory Token</span> (once per activation).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>End of Activation</h4>
            <p>Once a hero concludes their actions, their activation ends. Players then choose the next hero to activate.</p>

            <h3>3. Enemy Phase</h3>
            <p>After all heroes and their deployed units have activated, enemies surge forth:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Each enemy moves towards the nearest visible hero or deployed Unit Card. If none are visible, they advance towards the nearest objective.</li>
                <li><strong>Attack:</b> If an enemy is in range, it attacks. Enemies have a fixed combat profile. Targeted heroes/units roll Saves as normal.</li>
                <li><strong><span class="keyword">Curse</span> Cards (Optional):</strong> In certain scenarios, players may draw a <span class="keyword">Curse</span> card from the <span class="keyword">Curse</span> deck, unleashing negative effects.</li>
            </ol>

                            <em>2. <strong>To Wound:</strong> For the 2 Hits, Michael rolls 2 dice (e.g., 2, 4). One roll (4) is 3+ or higher. Result: 1 Wound.</em><br>
                            <em>3. <strong>Rend & Save:</strong> Francis's 3+ Save is reduced by Michael's Rend -1, making it a 4+ Save. Francis rolls 1 die (e.g., 3). This is less than 4+, so the Save fails. Result: 1 Unsaved Wound.</em><br>

            <h2>Campaign Progression: The Saga of Abbey Dawn</h2>
            <p>"Abbey Dawn: Last Stand" is not merely a series of battles, but a desperate saga played out as a series of linked scenarios, each advancing the desperate struggle against the encroaching darkness, pushing the heroes to their very limits. The campaign is structured into two main arcs: the initial defense and the climactic counter-offensive.</p>

            <h3>Introductory Scenarios: The Gathering Storm</h3>
            <p>These initial scenarios depict the first desperate struggles for Abbey Dawn, as the forces of Order react to the sudden and overwhelming invasion.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 1: The First Breach</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The very walls of Abbey Dawn tremble as the initial Chaos incursions crash against them. Players must valiantly defend three key defensive positions along the outer walls for 5 harrowing turns, or bravely defeat the formidable Chaos Champion leading this initial, brutal assault.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> The heroes begin their desperate stand within the hallowed confines of the walls. Units of Khorne and Tzeentch are strategically placed at designated breach points, poised to overwhelm the defenses.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "The air itself screams with their arrival, a cacophony of hatred and despair! Stand fast, brothers and sisters, for the fate of Abbey Dawn rests upon our blades!"<br>
                â€” Knight-Questor Kelly, The Unyielding Star
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 2: The Whispering Woods</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A vital supply convoy, carrying desperately needed provisions, is ambushed deep within the Emerald Bastion's ancient woods by Orruks. Heroes must secure the convoy and clear the path, ensuring its safe passage to Abbey Dawn.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Heroes start at one edge of a dense forest board. The convoy (represented by an objective marker) is in the center, surrounded by Orruk units. Reinforcements arrive from the edges.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "The forest itself weeps. These foul creatures infest our sacred groves. We must purge them!"<br>
                â€” Spirit-Warden Vicki, Voice of the Ancient Glade
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 3: The Sunken Vault</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ancient artifacts, believed to hold power against Chaos, are hidden within a forgotten, waterlogged vault beneath the Silverwood Citadel. Tzeentchian forces seek to claim them. Heroes must reach and secure the artifacts before the Arcanites can corrupt them or escape.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup: Evidently, I missed this section earlier. I will update this.</strong></p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "Their whispers pollute the very stone. We must retrieve the relics before their insidious magic claims them!"<br>
                â€” Loreweaver Lyra, Seeker of Lost Runes
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 4: The Grave-Tide's Rise</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A terrifying tide of Soulblight, led by a powerful Vampire Lord, rises from an ancient barrow-mound, threatening to engulf a nearby village. Heroes must stem the tide of undead and defeat the Vampire Lord before the village falls.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> A board with a central barrow-mound and a small village. Soulblight units emerge from the mound, advancing on the village. The Vampire Lord is a formidable foe.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "Their cold embrace seeks to claim the living. Not while I draw breath! To arms!"<br>
                â€” Lord-Celestant Michael, Hammer of the Dawn
            </div>

            <h3>Climactic Scenarios: The Counter-Offensive</h3>
            <p>Having weathered the initial storm, the heroes of Abbey Dawn launch a desperate counter-offensive, striking at the heart of the enemy's power.</p>

            <h4>Scenario 5: The Heart of the Blight</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Assault the enemy's primary corrupted stronghold, defeat the Grand Master of Chaos, a being of immense power, and sever the dark ritual that empowers their endless forces. This is the ultimate test of their courage and skill.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> The battlefield transforms into a sprawling, utterly corrupted landscape. The Grand Master of Chaos is protected by elite, fanatical units drawn from all Chaos and Destruction sub-factions encountered throughout the arduous campaign, a final, insurmountable obstacle.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "This is it. The final stand. For Abbey Dawn! For all we hold dear! Let our light banish their shadow!"<br>
                â€” Ghoul King Vorlag, The Starved Blade of Justice
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 6: The Cleansing Flame</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> A powerful Chaos artifact, a beacon of dark energy, must be destroyed to weaken the enemy's hold on the region. Heroes must fight their way to the artifact, activate a cleansing ritual, and defend it until it is purged.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> A central, heavily defended Chaos shrine. Waves of enemies (mixed Chaos factions) will attempt to disrupt the ritual. Heroes must spend glory to progress the ritual.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "This foul relic must be unmade! Let the fires of purification consume it!"<br>
                â€” Loreweaver Lyra, Seeker of Lost Runes
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 7: The Final Stand at Abbey Dawn</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The enemy, desperate after their losses, launches a final, all-out assault on the very heart of Abbey Dawn. Heroes must defend the central Keep against overwhelming numbers until reinforcements arrive or the enemy's morale breaks.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> A large board depicting the inner defenses of Abbey Dawn's Keep, with multiple entry points. Endless waves of mixed Chaos and Destruction units. This is a survival scenario.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "They want our home, our hope. They will have neither! To the walls, for Abbey Dawn!"<br>
                â€” Lord-Celestant Michael, Hammer of the Dawn
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 8: Echoes of Victory / Despair</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> This scenario is a narrative conclusion based on the outcome of Scenario 7. If Scenario 7 was won, this is a victory celebration/epilogue. If Scenario 7 was lost, this depicts the final, tragic fall of Abbey Dawn.</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Varies greatly based on outcome. Could be a small, ceremonial board for victory, or a desolate, overrun board for defeat.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                "We have endured the storm. Abbey Dawn stands, battered but unbowed. The light will always find a way to pierce the deepest shadows."<br>

            <p><strong>General Campaign Elements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario Objectives:</strong> Each scenario presents specific, vital objectives (e.g., defend a sacred location, eliminate a key enemy commander, escort a vulnerable VIP through perilous territory).</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Wounds:</strong> The scars of battle endure. <span class="keyword">Wounds</span> taken by heroes in one scenario might tragically carry over into the next, demanding strategic healing or forcing them to start with fewer <span class="keyword">Wounds</span>, adding a layer of grim realism.</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> For every hard-won victory in a scenario or the completion of specific <span class="keyword">Quests</span>, heroes might unlock new, more powerful cards for their decks or gain permanent, invaluable stat bonuses, reflecting their growth in the face of adversity.</li>
                <li><strong>Story Choices:</strong> Some pivotal scenarios might present players with difficult, branching choices that profoundly affect the campaign's narrative path, leading to different challenges and outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Drafting Your Force: Heroes & Units</h2>
            <p>Before embarking on a campaign or an adversarial battle, players will engage in a strategic Draft to assemble their force of Heroes and supporting Units. This ensures variety and replayability, as players must adapt their strategies based on available champions and their accompanying forces.</p>
            <p>The game is optimized for 2-8 players. The number of heroes and units each player controls can be scaled:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2 Players:</strong> Each player controls 3 heroes and drafts 3 Unit Cards to add to their heroes' decks.</li>
                <li><strong>3-4 Players:</strong> Each player controls 2 heroes and drafts 2 Unit Cards to add to their heroes' decks.</li>
                <li><strong>5-8 Players:</strong> Each player controls 1 hero and drafts 1 Unit Card to add to their hero's deck.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initial Hero Selection:</strong> For a cooperative campaign, each player first chooses one hero from the entire roster to be their primary champion. For adversarial mode, each player chooses one hero to be their faction leader.</li>
                <li><strong>Hero Draft Rounds:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All remaining heroes not chosen in step 1 are shuffled into a "Hero Draft Pool" deck.</li>
                        <li>Players take turns drafting additional heroes from this pool until each player has their allocated number of heroes. For 2 players, Player 1 draws 2, picks one, passes the other. Player 2 then takes that hero. Repeat. For more players, each player draws 2, picks one, passes left.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Unit Card Draft Rounds:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A separate "Unit Card Draft Pool" is created, containing all available Unit Cards.</li>
                        <li>Players then take turns drafting Unit Cards from this pool until each player has their allocated number of Unit Cards. Each drafted Unit Card is then added to the deck of one of their chosen heroes. Players decide which hero receives which Unit Card, allowing for synergistic deck building.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Finalizing Rosters:</strong> Once all drafting rounds are complete, players reveal their full hero and unit rosters. This strategic choice of heroes and units will significantly impact the tactical options available in the upcoming scenario.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="example"><em>Example: In a 2-player cooperative campaign, Player A chooses Lord-Celestant Michael as their initial hero. Player B chooses Loreweaver Lyra. For the Hero Draft, the remaining 16 heroes are shuffled. Player A draws 2, picks one (e.g., Knight-Questor Kelly), and passes the other to Player B. Player B then takes that hero. This process repeats until both players have their 3 chosen heroes. Then, a separate pool of Unit Cards is prepared, and players take turns drafting 3 Unit Cards each. Player A might draft a 'Liberator Unit' card and add it to Michael's deck, and an 'Aelven Wardens' card to Kelly's deck.</em></p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chaos vs. Order: Adversarial Game Mode</h2>
            <p>For those who seek a direct confrontation, "Abbey Dawn: Last Stand" offers an adversarial game mode where one player commands the valiant **Order Heroes** (defending), and another commands the brutal **Chaos and Destruction Heroes** (attacking).</p>
            <h3>Game Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One player selects their allocated number of Order Heroes and drafts their Unit Cards from the Order Unit Pool, adding them to their heroes' decks.</li>
                <li>The other player selects their allocated number of Chaos/Destruction Heroes and drafts their Unit Cards from the Chaos/Destruction Unit Pool, adding them to their heroes' decks.</li>
                <li>A specific scenario is chosen (e.g., "The First Breach" or a custom objective-based map). The scenario will define the defender's setup zone and the attacker's deployment.</li>
                <li>Each hero has their own unique card deck, now supplemented by drafted Unit Cards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Turn Structure</h3>
            <p>The game proceeds in alternating player turns, rather than distinct phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Order Player Turn:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generates Glory for their active heroes.</li>
                        <li>Activates each of their heroes and deployed Unit Cards one at a time, performing movement, playing cards (abilities, spells, blessings, unit deployments, quests), and resolving combat.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Chaos/Destruction Player Turn:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generates Glory for their active heroes.</li>
                        <li>Activates each of their heroes and deployed Unit Cards one at a time, performing movement, playing cards (abilities, spells, blessings, unit deployments, quests), and resolving combat.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The game continues until the scenario objectives are met or one side is entirely defeated. This mode offers a direct, competitive experience, testing tactical prowess against a thinking opponent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Winning and Losing</h2>
            <p>The fate of Abbey Dawn hangs in the balance, determined by the heroes' success or failure. The struggle for the realms is an endless, grinding war, and sometimes, even a 'win' is merely a reprieve, a moment of respite before the next wave of darkness crashes upon the shores of hope.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winning a Scenario:</strong> Players achieve victory in a scenario by successfully completing all its primary objectives before a specific turn limit is reached, or before all their valiant heroes are tragically defeated. Alternatively, players can achieve a special victory by either holding 3 active Blessing cards simultaneously on the battlefield, or by successfully casting a total of 4 Blessing cards within a single scenario.</li>
                <li><strong>Losing a Scenario:</strong> Players suffer defeat if all heroes are incapacitated or removed from play, or if a critical objective is irrevocably failed (e.g., a key NPC dies, a vital location is overrun by the enemy hordes).</li>
                <li><strong>Campaign Victory:</strong> The entire campaign is won by successfully completing all introductory scenarios and then triumphantly completing the final, climactic scenario, successfully pushing back the main invasion force and securing Abbey Dawn's future.</li>
                <li><strong>Campaign Defeat:</strong> The campaign is tragically lost if too many scenarios are lost, leading to the inevitable and devastating fall of Abbey Dawn to the forces of darkness.</li>
